# Excel Sales Analysis – Excel Portfolio Project

## Overview
I cleaned and explored a retail sales dataset using Excel that I acquired from Kaggle. The data was cleaned, formatted, and analyzed using pivot tables and charts to uncover trends and insights, focusing on Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin across Category, Region & Segment, and Ship Mode.

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw superstore dataset for analysis
- Format columns correctly (currency, percentages, text)
- Create pivot tables to summarize data by Segment, Region, and Ship Mode
- Build charts to visualize Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets (Excel equivalent)

## Data Cleaning & Analysis Steps
### Data Cleaning
- Opened the Superstore dataset  
- Removed duplicate rows  
- Checked key columns for blanks  
- Created a **Profit Margin** column  
- Standardized data types  
- Verified categorical columns  

### Pivot Table Analysis
- Pivot 1: Sales and Avg Profit Margin by Category
  - Bar chart shows total Sales per Category
  - Line chart shows Avg Profit Margin per Category
- Pivot 3: Sales, Profit, and Avg Profit Margin by **Region** and **Customer Segment**  
- Pivot 4: Sales, Profit, Avg Profit Margin, and Number of Orders by **Ship Mode**  

## Key Insights
- **Consumer segment** generated the highest sales  
- **West region** had the highest total revenue  
- **Technology category** showed the strongest profit margin  
- **Standard shipping mode** was the most frequently used
